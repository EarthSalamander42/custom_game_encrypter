# encrypter
Method of encrypting game files, made by the late Ark120202

Unforotunately only Ark knows how this works in detail. I know the principle behind it is, that it uses the secret dedicated server key to encrypt LUA files (and also javascript, but I know even less about that) so that the code only becomes useable when it is played on the official workshop entry, with the correct secret code. I have left some of the file structure in config as an example, but you will need to update that for your game.
